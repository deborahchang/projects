Data 102 Mortality Project
Using the "In Hospital Mortality Prediction" dataset (https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.0p2ngf1zd), we applied GLMS and nonparametric methods as well as Causal Inference to explore 2 research questions:
1. Under the mortality dataset setting, does having diabetes cause a higher BMI?
2. Under the mortality dataset setting, what is the overall accuracy of using GLM and non-parametric methods to predict the outcome?
